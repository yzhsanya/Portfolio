                    <p>A claim that visitors to the production facility in Graz will hear often.
                       The G-Class has been hand-built here for the last 35 years - filling
                        everyone involved with pride. The variety of models necessitates to
                        this day a manual process on just one production line. From a range
                        of more than 10,000 individual parts, experienced technicians therefore
                        select the 3000 or so that they need, which they then assemble with
                        exemplary care to create a new G-Class. Only after more than 100 manhours of work - almost three times as much as for a machine-produced
                        vehicle - will a G-Class leave its place of origin</p>
                   <p>From groundbreaking safety features to our electrification initiatives, Mercedes-Benz is at the forefront of automotive innovation. Our goal is to provide not just a car, but a driving experience that is unparalleled.</p>
                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

                          <p>In autumn 2000, Mercedes-Benz gave the 463-series G-Class, which had already been on the market for more than ten years, a comprehensive facelift. The revised models debuted at the Paris Motor Show in September 2000 with a new interior design, even more extensive standard equipment and numerous technical innovations. The most important change in the model range was the discontinuation of the G 300 Turbodiesel, whose role as the most powerful compression-ignition model was taken over by the new G 400 CDI. The engine used here was the common-rail V8 diesel engine familiar from the S-Class, which produced 184 kW/250 hp from 4.0 litres of displacement and delivered a commanding peak torque of 560 Nm.n terms of its external appearance and gross list prices, which initially ranged from DM 149,284.59 for the convertible version to DM 146,788.95 for the long station wagon, the G 400 CDI was exactly the same as the G 500, which until then had been the sole top model in the series.With regard to driving performance, the diesel- and petrol-powered top models also showed almost identical values. Both stood out externally with particularly elegant design elements, such as silver-painted 18-inch light-alloy wheels with shiny wheel covers, chrome crossbars in the radiator grille and bumpers painted in the vehicle colour.</p>

                      <h2>1979 - 1992</h2><!--Old G-Class history-->
                      <p>In February 1979, the presentation of the Mercedes-Benz G models broke completely new ground. Although off-road passenger cars from Mercedes-Benz had existed before 1945, they were primarily used by civilian and non-civilian government institutions. The new generation of off-road vehicles was however designed for rugged everyday use in the industrial or municipal sectors on the one hand, but also as an exclusive means of transport of a recreational nature on the other.The development work had been carried out in cooperation with Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG, which had expanded and extended the Puch plant in Graz-Thondorf for series production of the G model. Production was initially the responsibility of "Gelände-Fahrzeug GmbH" (GFG), in which both partners each held a 50 % share, within the framework of a cooperation agreement; in August 1981, Daimler-Benz relinquished its share in GFG, and since then the Mercedes-Benz off-road vehicles have been produced by Steyr-Daimler-Puch on a contract basis. In Austria, Switzerland and the then COMECON countries, the otherwise completely identical vehicles were sold under the brand name "Puch".</p>
